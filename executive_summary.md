# Executive Summary: Career Progression and Promotion Gap Analysis for Retention Optimization

## Project Overview

**Project Title:** Career Progression and Promotion Gap Analysis for Retention Optimization  
**Organization:** Palo Alto Networks  
**Research Lead:** Vinay Sharma, Data Science Intern  
**Program:** Unified Mentor  
**Date:** February 2026  
**Dataset:** 1,470 employee records with comprehensive career and satisfaction metrics

## Executive Summary

### The Challenge

Palo Alto Networks, like many technology organizations, faces significant challenges in employee retention. Traditional attrition models predict who might leave but fail to explain the underlying structural career issues driving disengagement. This analysis addresses a critical gap: understanding why employees eventually disengage due to career stagnation, promotion gaps, and limited growth opportunities.

### The Solution

We developed a comprehensive **Career Intelligence Framework** that transforms retention management from reactive to proactive. By analyzing career progression patterns, we can identify employees at risk of disengagement before they become dissatisfied, enabling targeted interventions that address root causes rather than symptoms.

## Key Findings

### 1. Career Trajectory Analysis

**Three Distinct Career Clusters Identified:**
- **Fast-Track Performers (61.7%):** Younger employees with balanced career progression
- **Promotion-Stalled Employees (35.4%):** Experienced employees showing career stagnation
- **Early-Career Explorers (2.9%):** New employees with high attrition risk

### 2. Promotion Gap Risk Assessment

**Risk Distribution:**
- **High Risk:** 110 employees (7.5%) - Immediate intervention required
- **Medium Risk:** 590 employees (40.1%) - Proactive monitoring needed
- **Low Risk:** 770 employees (52.4%) - Maintain current strategies

**Critical Insight:** Sales department shows highest promotion gap risk, with 23% higher risk than Research & Development.

### 3. Retention Opportunity Identification

**224 employees (15.2% of workforce)** identified for immediate career intervention:
- **High Priority:** 47 employees requiring urgent action
- **Training Needed:** 156 employees lacking skill development
- **Promotion Review:** 89 employees ready for advancement
- **Role Rotation:** 67 employees experiencing role stagnation
